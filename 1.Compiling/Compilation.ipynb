    "## Install conda\n",
    "\n",
    "First install conda by visiting: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",

    "\n",
    "## Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is once the distribution has been installed we should create a \n",
    "virtual environment on which to deploy PyEW, or we can always install it at the\n",

    "    conda create --name pyew\n",

    "    conda install cython jupyter numpy flask configparser pillow scipy matplotlib\n",

    "source the environment file for earthworm prior to these next steps. To do this\n",
    "we first download the source from here using git:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/PyEarthWorm.git\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then we 'cd' into the src directory:\n",
