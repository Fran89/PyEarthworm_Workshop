#       Startstop (Unix Version -- Linux) Configuration File
#
#    <nRing> is the number of transport rings to create.
#    <Ring> specifies the name of a ring followed by it's size
#    in kilobytes, eg        Ring    WAVE_RING 1024
#    The maximum size of a ring depends on your operating system, 
#    amount of physical RAM and configured virtual (paging) memory 
#    available. A good place to start is 1024 kilobytes. 
#    Ring names are listed in file earthworm.d.
#
# refer to the wiki for how to change your specific system's shared memory
# size - if you encounter problems with large or too many rings, this is probably
# the issue.
