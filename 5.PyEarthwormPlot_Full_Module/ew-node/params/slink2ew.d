#SLRecSize       512             # Size (in bytes) of the SEED records expected
                                 # from the server.  Traditionally SeedLink only
                                 # uses 512-byte SEED records.  This option is for
                                 # use with specialized servers that use alternate
                                 # records lengths such as 256 or 128.  One such
                                 # specialized server is the RockToSLink module.

# Selectors and Stream's.  If any Stream lines are specified the connection
# to the SeedLink server will be configured in multi-station mode using
# Selectors, if any, as defaults.  If no Stream lines are specified the
# connection will be configured in uni-station mode using Selectors, if any.

#Selectors      "HN?.D"           # SeedLink selectors.  These selectors are used
                                 # for a uni-station mode connection.  If one
                                 # or more 'Stream' entries are given these are
                                 # used as default selectors for multi-station
                                 # mode data streams.  See description of
                                 # SeedLink selectors below.  Multiple selectors
                                 # must be enclosed in quotes.


# List each data stream (a network and station code pair) that you
# wish to request from the server with a "Stream" command.  If one or
# more Stream commands are given the connection will be configured in
# multi-station mode (multiple station data streams over a single
# network connection).  If no Stream commands are specified the
# connection will be configured in uni-station mode, optionally using
# any specified "Selectors".  A Stream command should be followed by a
# stream key, a network code followed by a station code separated by
# an underscore (i.e. IU_KONO).  SeedLink selectors for a specific
# stream may optionally be specified after the stream key.  Multiple
# selectors must be enclosed in quotes.  Any selectors specified with
# the Selectors command above are used as defaults when no selectors
# are specified for a given stream.

#Stream  GE_DSB   "BH?.D HH?.D"
#Stream  II_KONO  00BH?.D

# Some SeedLink servers support extended selection capability and
# allow wildcars (either '*' or '?') for both the network and station
# fields, for example to request all stations from the TA network:

#Stream  PR_*
Stream  PR_AOPR
#Stream  PR_PRSN


#(notes regarding "selectors" from a SeedLink configuration file)
#
#   The "selectors" parameter tells to request packets that match given
#   selectors. This helps to reduce network traffic. A packet is sent to
#   client if it matches any positive selector (without leading "!") and
#   doesn't match any negative selectors (with "!"). General format of
#   selectors is LLSSS.T, where LL is location, SSS is channel, and T is
#   type (one of DECOTL for data, event, calibration, blockette, timing,
#   and log records). "LL", ".T", and "LLSSS." can be omitted, meaning
#   "any". It is also possible to use "?" in place of L and S.
#
#   Some examples:
#   BH?            - BHZ, BHN, BHE (all record types)
#   00BH?          - BHZ, BHN, BHE with location code '00' (all record types)
#   BH?.D          - BHZ, BHN, BHE (data records)
#   BH? !E         - BHZ, BHN, BHE (excluding detection records)
#   BH? E          - BHZ, BHN, BHE plus detection records of all channels
#   !LCQ !LEP      - exclude LCQ and LEP channels
#   !L !T          - exclude log and timing records
#
#
# For slink2ew no record types except data records will be written to
# the ring.  In other words, requesting any records in addition to
# data records is a waste.
